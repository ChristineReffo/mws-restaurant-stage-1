## Introduction

The Udacity MWS Restaurant Reviews project is part of the Front-end Web Development nanodegree, requiring students to build in responsiveness for multiple screen size using css and mediaqueries (no frameworks), to add accessibility features and to integrate a Service Worker to allow for offline use.
